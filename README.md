# ECCrypto: Asymmetric Cryptographic Algorithm

## Overview

Welcome to ECCrypto, a C++ cryptographic algorithm project that leverages Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) with a unique twist. ECCrypto operates within a public key cryptosystem, generating private and public keys for both sender and receiver. The core feature of ECCrypto is the conversion of characters from the text file `message.txt` into points on elliptic curves, ensuring secure communication. This project allows you to encrypt messages using the receiver's public key and decrypt them with the receiver's private key.

## Key Features

-  **Elliptic Curve Cryptography:** ECCrypto harnesses the power of ECC, known for its robust security.
-  **Character-to-Point Conversion:** ECCrypto's innovation involves converting characters into points on elliptic curves enhancing data security.
-  **Public Key Cryptosystem:** ECCrypto generates private and public keys for both sender and receiver, establishing a secure communication channel.
-  **Message Encryption:** You can encrypt messages using the receiver's public key, ensuring confidentiality during transmission.
-  **Message Decryption:** Decrypt messages using the receiver's private key, restoring the original content.

## Getting Started
